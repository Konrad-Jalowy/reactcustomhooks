# React Custom Hooks Project

In this project I try out custom react hooks. Hooks will be in hooks directory, examples in components directory. Enjoy.

## Hooks Done

### useToggle
Simple hook that lets you toggle between boolean states, true or false

### usePrev
Hook that uses refs to show you previous value of a reactive variable (first part returned by useState hook)
